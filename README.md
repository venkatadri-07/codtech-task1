**OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT**

The Basic Calculator program is a simple Java application that performs basic arithmetic operations. Here's an overview of the project:

**Features**
**User Input:**

The program prompts the user to enter two numbers.

It asks the user to select an operation from a menu of four options:

Addition (+)
Subtraction (-)
Multiplication (*)
Division (/)
Operations:

Depending on the user's choice, the program performs the corresponding operation:

**Addition:** Adds the two numbers.

**Subtraction:** Subtracts the second number from the first.

**Multiplication:** Multiplies the two numbers.

**Division:** Divides the first number by the second, with error handling for division by zero. 

**Result Display:**

The result of the chosen operation is displayed to the user in a clear and concise manner.
Error Handling:

The program ensures division by zero is handled gracefully, displaying an error message instead of crashing.

It also validates the user's choice of operation and informs them if their input is invalid.

**User Experience:**

Provides a simple, text-based interface that is easy to navigate.

Closes with a thank-you message after the operation is completed.

**Workflow**
**Start:** The program begins by welcoming the user to the calculator.

**Input:** The user enters two numbers and selects an operation.

**Processing:** The program performs the selected operation.

**Output:** The result is displayed, or an appropriate error message is shown.

**End:** The program thanks the user and terminates.

**Technology**

**Programming Language:** Java

**Libraries:** Utilizes Java's built-in Scanner class for user input handling.

**Potential Enhancements**

Add more operations like modulus (%), power, or square root.

Allow the user to perform multiple calculations in one session.

Enhance input validation for non-numeric inputs.

Create a graphical user interface (GUI) for better user experience.

Add logging features to store calculation history.

This program is an excellent starting point for beginners learning Java and helps demonstrate key programming concepts like input/output, conditional statements, and switch-case structures.
